This repository contains some research projects on bitcoin by Weiran Lin, directed by Professor Andrew Miller. These projects try to solve the problem that if we can tell the topology of the bitcoin world by only passively listening on the time information of bitcoin transactions.(This could be a serious attack. Although there are existing possible attacks using transaction injection, active listening requires bitcoin expenses and hence are expensive). In the order of time, the verbatim graph tool comes first, and then the simulation. More details about them and particular usage can be found at the usage.txt within every project directory.Though it did not come up with extremely fruitful research results, it was great fun to work on these. 
Ultimately, thanks Professor Andrew Miller for his guidance, patience, time and support in these projects,
